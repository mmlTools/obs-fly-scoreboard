# Hotkeys

Bind keys in **OBS → Settings → Hotkeys**. Look for entries starting with:

**“Fly Scoreboard:”**
- Home Score +1 / −1  
- Guests Score +1 / −1  
- Home Wins +1 / −1  
- Guests Wins +1 / −1  
- Swap Home ↔ Guests  
- Show/Hide Scoreboard

> Hotkeys persist per **OBS profile**. Switch profiles? The plugin restores bindings after load.
